# commands

This MD file contains a list of all the angular commands I have used from time to time for this repo.

## Getting started

- Installing Angular CLI
	```sh
	sudo apt install node
	sudo apt install npm
	npm install -g typescript
	npm install -g @angular/cli
	```

- Create a new project
    ```sh
    ng new projectname
    ```

- Run the current on a localhost
    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

- Create a new component
	```sh
	cd src/app  # navigate to the app directory, then enter:
	ng generate component comp  # replace 'comp' by your component name
	```
